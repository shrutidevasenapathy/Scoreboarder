# Scoreboarder

Basic application to assist with scoreboarding specific to SSBM. 

Requires: 
- Python 3 (or above)
- Some specific pip packages - `pillow` (TODO - find list of required packages and add them here.) If you have Python 3 set up and also have the PATH variables set up correctly, the command to install the package would be:
`pip install pillow`

Is available for use if you credit me as "VogelLover"

Todo (for readme):
- Add set of instructions on customizing Scoreboarder
- Add better instructions on running Scoreboader
- Add upcoming features
