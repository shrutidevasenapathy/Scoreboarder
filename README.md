# Scoreboarder

Basic application to assist with scoreboarding specific to SSBM. 

## Requires: 
- Python 3 (or above)
- Some specific pip packages - `pillow` (TODO - find list of required packages and add them here.) If you have Python 3 set up and also have the PATH variables set up correctly, the command to install the package would be:
`pip install pillow`

## How to setup and start Scoreboarder
The app and the instructions have been tested on Windows 10
- You must have python and the required python modules installed (see above)
- You need two separate folders (not contained in this repository) - one containing character icons and the other with stage icons.
- Download this entire repository using git OR by going to https://github.com/shrutidevasenapathy/Scoreboarder/archive/master.zip and extract from zip
- Fill in the path to character icons, stage icons, the destination folders (for OBS) etc. in `folderMap.json`.
- Open command prompt in the top level folder and type command as `py StartScoreboarder.py`
